You are deciding whether an Anki flashcard should receive an AI-generated image.

Return only `true` or `false`.

Rules:
1. Return `true` when an image would materially improve memory (concrete objects, actions, scenes, emotions, vivid concepts).
2. Return `false` for function words, grammar particles/endings, connectors, abstract discourse markers, or cards where images are likely low-value.
3. Favor `false` when uncertain.
4. Do not explain.
